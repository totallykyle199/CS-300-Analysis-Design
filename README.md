# CS-300-Analysis-Design

-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

 - The main projects involveed solving problems related to data structures and algorithms. These involved analyzing the run-time and memory usage of data structures and sorting and printing a list of courses for a computer science program.

 -How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  - While approaching these problems I first had to understand the problem and requirments for the project. I then determined the best data structure to use based on the characteristics of the problem.

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

 - The main roadblocks I encountered was trying to understand the different complexities of each data structure. To overcome this I reviewed class notes and different examples I found online to help me understand these data structures.

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

 - Working on these projects has expanded my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. It has also taught me the importance of choosing the most appropriate one based on the requirments of the project.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

 - These projects have changed the way I approached creating programs by maintaining a code that is readable and adaptable, and has reinforced the importance of a modular design.
